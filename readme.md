## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a metric function name ACscore (accuracy-score) in both Matlab and Python for evaluating binary classifiers, as well as example usage. The formula of AC-score is symmetric with both classes, making it robust for both balanced and unbalanced datasets.

## article
The original article introducing the ACscore metric is "Accuracy Score for Evaluation of Classification on Imbalanced Data".
Matlab codes for reproducing figures in the article are under the figure/ folder.
